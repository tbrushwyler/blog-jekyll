    <h3 id="what-is-bluetooth-le">What is Bluetooth LE?</h3>

<p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an iteration on Bluetooth technology that was built for the Internet of Things. It is <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-technology-basics/low-energy" target="_blank">power-friendly and implemented on all major operating systems</a>, making it a great option for close-range communication with “smart” objects.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-developer-what-do-i-need-to-know-about-bluetooth-le">As a developer, what do I need to know about Bluetooth LE?</h3>

<p>Every BLE device has a set of endpoints that allow other BLE devices to interact with it. The endpoints are included in the <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/generic-attribute-profile" target="_blank">Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)</a> of the device.</p>

<p>A device has a single GATT profile that makes up its interface. At the top level, a device has a set of services. Each service is made up of a set of characteristics. These characteristics are the actual endpoints that allow interaction with the device. Each characteristic has a set of properties that determine how other devices are allowed to interact with it. Characteristics can allow any combination of the following interactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read</strong>: allows clients to read this characteristic using any of the read operations</li>
  <li><strong>Write</strong>: allows clients to use the Write Request/Response operation</li>
  <li><strong>WriteWithoutResponse</strong>: allows clients to use the Write Command operation</li>
  <li><strong>Notify</strong>: allows the server to use the Handle Value Notification operation</li>
  <li><strong>Indicate</strong>: allows the server to use the Handle Value Indication/Confirmation operation</li>
  <li><strong>SignedWrite</strong>: allows clients to use the Signed Write Command operation</li>
  <li><strong>WritableAuxilliaries</strong>: allows a client to write to the Characteristic User Description descriptor</li>
  <li><strong>Broadcast</strong>: allows this characteristic value to be placed in advertising packets</li>
</ul>

<p>There are reserved <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServicesHome.aspx" target="_blank">services</a> and <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/characteristics/Pages/CharacteristicsHome.aspx" target="_blank">characteristics</a> for specific types of devices and information. For example, a <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServiceViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml" target="_blank">heart rate monitor</a> will always have a service with identifier 0x180D that has characteristics 0x2A37, 0x2A38, and 0x2A39. Before beginning development, be sure to fully document the GATT profile for the device.</p>

<h3 id="bluetooth-le-in-ios">Bluetooth LE in iOS</h3>

<p>The BLE implementation for iOS is all included in the Core Bluetooth framework. Apple has provided very <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/CoreBluetoothOverview/CoreBluetoothOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013257-CH2-SW1" target="_blank">helpful documentation</a> detailing the data structure and use of this framework.</p>

<p>Basically, the data structure follows its physical representation. Using a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CBCentralManager_Class/index.html" target="_blank">CBCentralManager</a>, you can scan for and connect to devices (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CBPeripheral_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/CBPeripheral" target="_blank">CBPeripheral</a>). The central manager’s functionality is limited to device discovery, connection, and disconnection. Once connected to a device, the CBPeripheral object is the main interface for interacting with the device. You can discover the device’s services (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CBService_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/CBService" target="_blank">CBService</a>), discover a service’s characteristics (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CBCharacteristic_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/swift/cl/c:objc(cs)CBCharacteristic" target="_blank">CBCharacteristic</a>), and interact directly with the characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="bluetooth-le-in-android">Bluetooth LE in Android</h3>
<p>BLE in Android is a little less straight-forward. The main interface is the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothAdapter.html" target="_blank">BluetoothAdapter</a>, which is required for any and all Bluetooth activity. Once a device (<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGatt.html" target="_blank">BluetoothGatt</a>) is discovered, you can connect to that object by calling a method (<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice.html#connectGatt(android.content.Context, boolean, android.bluetooth.BluetoothGattCallback)" target="_blank">.connectGatt()</a>) on it. The returned object is the connected device, with which you can interact the same as above.</p>

<p>The confusing part for me is the device discovery and connection. Callbacks (<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback.html" target="_blank">LeScanCallback</a> &amp; <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback.html" target="_blank">BluetoothGattCallback</a>) are passed to the discovery and connection to handle errors/success. These classes need to be extended and implemented to properly show devices and connect to them.</p>

<h3 id="cross-platform-bluetooth-le">Cross-Platform Bluetooth LE</h3>

<p>Sharing code in a cross-platform app means that the implementation details for each platform need to be abstracted away. This gives us a blank canvas on which to build a new interface for BLE.</p>

<p>For ease of re-use, I have created a nuget package (<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/XamarinBluetoothLE" target="_blank">Xamarin.BluetoothLE</a>) with the iOS and Android Bluetooth LE implementation abstracted away. You can <a href="https://github.com/tbrushwyler/Xamarin.BluetoothLE" target="_blank">view/contribute to the source on Github</a>. The framework is largely based on the <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Monkey.Robotics" target="_blank">Monkey.Robotics project</a>, but with some updates and changes. Because of the confusion introduced by the callbacks in Android, the framework is modeled more similarly to the iOS implementation of BLE. C# introduces the opportunity for raising events when important things happen.</p>

<p>The documentation for the Xamarin.BluetoothLE package can be found <a href="https://github.com/tbrushwyler/Xamarin.BluetoothLE/wiki/N_BluetoothLE_Core">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>With the incredibly fast growth of the IoT world, Bluetooth (specifically BLE) is a valid option for communication with smart objects. My hope is that this cross-platform library will help app developers to be able to look past the nitty gritty details of BLE implementation and to instead focus on using this technology to create great things.</p>
